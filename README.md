1) no question answer:

Answer is A: {}.

Explain:The let keyword is used to declare a variable with block scope. This means that the variable is only accessible within the block of code where it is declared. The greetign variable is declared on the first line of the code snippet, and it is assigned an empty object on the second line. The console.log() function logs the value of the variable greetign to the console on the third line. Since the variable greetign is assigned an empty object, the output of the code snippet will be an empty object as well.


2) no question answer:

Answer is D: 3

Explain: The forEach method iterates over each element in the nums array. In JavaScript, the condition if (num) checks if the current element is truthy (not equal to 0). Since 0 is falsy, only the elements 1, 2, and 3 will satisfy the condition, and the count will be incremented for each of these elements. Therefore, the final value of count will be 3, and it will be logged to the console.

3) no question answer:

Answer is A: ['??', '??', '??', '??']

Explain: The info.favoriteFood is assigned the value "??," but this assignment does not affect the original food array. The console.log(food) will output the original contents of the food array, which remains unchanged.

4) no question answer:

Answer: B: Hi there, undefined

Explain: The sayHi function expects a parameter name, but when you call sayHi() without providing an argument, the name parameter inside the function becomes undefined. Therefore, the function returns a string with "Hi there, undefined," and this will be logged to the console.
